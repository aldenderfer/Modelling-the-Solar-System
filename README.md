Modelling-the-Solar-System
==========================

A first attempt at both learning Processing and creating an interactive model of the solar system.

This was written in the spring of 2013 as an attempt to learn the Processing language and structure, while at the same time to create an interactive model of our local neighborhoord.

This code is messy and inefficient, and could be extensively re-factored. But as I've moved on to other projects, I no longer have time to undertake a complete overhaul. The project remains entertaining nonetheless.
