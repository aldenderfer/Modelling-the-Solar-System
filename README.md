Modelling-the-Solar-System
==========================

A first attempt at both learning Processing and creating an interactive model of the solar system. This was written in the spring of 2013 to see if I could teach myself Processing, as well as create an interactive model of our local neighborhoord.

This code is fairly messy and pretty darn inefficient, and could be extensively re-factored. But as I've moved on to other projects, I no longer have time to undertake a complete overhaul.

Working with Processing v2, not tested with Processing v3+.
